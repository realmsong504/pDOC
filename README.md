# pDOC v2.0
**Prognostication of chronic disorders of consciousness using individualized functional connectivity networks derived from resting-state fMRI and clinical characteristics**

---

## Introduction

Severe brain injury can lead to disorders of consciousness (DOC). Prognostication is a critical concern for DOC patients, as medical treatment and rehabilitation planning depend heavily on expected outcomes. However, accurately predicting long-term recovery remains a significant challenge.

For research purposes, we present **pDOC v2.0**, an updated software package designed to predict outcomes in chronic DOC patients (i.e., more than one month after the initial injury). This version provides a probability estimate of consciousness recovery for individual patients.

## ðŸ”„ What's New in v2.0

Compared to v1.0, the main enhancement in **pDOC v2.0** is the introduction of:

### âœ… **Individualized Regions of Interest (ROIs)**

- Brain functional networks are now calculated based on *subject-specific ROIs* instead of standard group-defined regions.
- This individualized approach improves the sensitivity of the prognostic model, reducing false negatives.
- Functional connectivity features derived from individualized ROIs are integrated with clinical characteristics in a combined model.

This new model demonstrated improved robustness and interpretability.

## Models Included

- **Clinical Model** â€“ based on clinical characteristics only.
- **Combined Model (Group ROI)** â€“ integrates clinical data with functional connectivity features derived from standard, group-defined ROIs (as in v1.0).
- **Combined Model (Individualized ROI)** â€“ integrates clinical data with functional connectivity based on subject-specific, individualized ROIs (introduced in v2.0).

## How to Use

Please refer to the documentation:  
ðŸ“„ `How_to_use.docx`

This document provides step-by-step instructions for:

- Data preparation
- ROI extraction
- Model input formatting
- Running the prediction
- Interpreting results

> In the graphical user interface (GUI), selecting **individual_ROI** via the corresponding radio button enables prediction using individualized ROIs.  
> The software will automatically compute and display results from **both the group ROI model** and the **individualized ROI model**, allowing for easy comparison.
